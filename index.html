              <span>
                Small and micro businesses with a minimum number of staff
                running the business are increasingly going online to present
                their goods and services to a wider audience or reach their
                target market on social media. Online tools have become very
                handy and attract most of the people due to the ease of use. So,
                for the business to succeed, you follow the pattern and go after
                your customers.</span
              ><br /><br />
              <span>
                Social media has set its standards for communication and
                research shows that photos and images with some design attract
                more customers than posting those as is. Businesses in the
                health and beauty industry, bakeries, shops, car repairs and
                other businesses alike either may not afford a designer or lack
                design skills or both at the same time. </span
              ><br /><br />
              This is exactly where a tool like Essemem is required, which
              anyone can use. Essemem can also be useful for agencies running
              social media pages for several small and micro businesses. It will
              help keep up the freshness of design ideas, consistency of style
              and branding elements.

              For whom Essemem is essential and irreplaceable tool?
            </h5>
            <p onclick="showText(event)" class="paragraphDefaultStyle">
              Jane owns a small beauty salon, which offers hair styling and nail
              care services. She often takes photos of customers' hair and
              hands, after the masterpieces are ready, and posts those on
              Facebook or Instagram. She is using both posts and stories,
              however, is always having a hard time with properly cropping the
              photos, adding texts and attaching the logo of her salon.<br /><br />
              Several times she tried to use templates available online,
              spending a lot of time on editing, picking the right colors and
              backgrounds, matching a font and making sure everything looks nice
              together. Jane figured out she is lacking design and tech skills
              to make this process a routine. Hiring a designer or outsourcing
              the task does not seem an option either.<br /><br />
              As soon as Jane learned about essemem she couldn't help playing
              with it, creating fantastic designs by a few clicks. With Essemem,
              she doesn't have to worry about design, composition, fonts,
              backgrounds, image cropping and sizing and so on. All of this
              hustle is gone and all she needs to do is upload the photo of her
              next masterpiece, drop a line addressing her audience and attach a
              logo to promote her salon. What happens next is amazing, Essemem
              instantly generates thousands of ready-to-post designs and every
              time Jane shares a unique post, which attracts and keeps her
              customers engaged.

            <h5 class="h5DefaultStyle">Comparison with other platforms?</h5>
            <p onclick="showText(event)" class="paragraphDefaultStyle">
              Major providers of ready templates in the online market have long
              been Canva, Picsart and Crello, with 150m, 70m, 30m users
              respectively. Canva has over 700 thousand templates but the
              problem is users always pick from the “most popular” ones, thus
              taking the risk of looking alike.<br /><br />
              Anyways, templates offered for editing require certain designer
              skills, technical knowledge and, at times, may take hours to
              compile a poster. You start editing a nice template, add your
              files to it and often end up with a look, which requires further
              editing to produce something marketable.<br /><br />
              Essemem has revolutionized this process by generating ads designs
              by using the customer's image, text and logo, not the opposite.
              The time saving and ease of use is incomparable to currently
              existing platforms. Moreover, Essemem will keep up with the
              uniqueness of its designs by implementing an AI engine, which will
              generate an infinite number of unique designs, never having a risk
              of repetition.
